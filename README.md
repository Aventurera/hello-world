My first Github repository

It's mid October and the air is starting to have a chill. Perhaps we'll be hit by an asteroid that changes our orbit around the sun and keeps this temperature constant for this altitude.  Aaaah, paradise.

The asteroid could also break into pieces which act as portkeys to different parts of Earth - allowing us to visit mountains or beach, or glacier, at will.
